# 13 Object-Relational Mapping (ORM): E-Commerce Back End

## Your Task
In this project, you will be leveraging your skills as a full-stack web developer to build the back end for an e-commerce site using Express.js and Sequelize. As e-commerce continues to dominate the electronics industry, with an estimated $29 trillion in revenue in 2019, it's crucial to understand the underlying architecture of these platforms. By modifying starter code, you will create a working API that interacts with a MySQL database, providing businesses of all sizes with the tools they need to succeed in the online retail space.

## User Story

```md
AS A manager at an internet retail company
I WANT a back end for my e-commerce website that uses the latest technologies
SO THAT my company can compete with other e-commerce companies
```

## Acceptance Criteria

```md
GIVEN a functional Express.js API

THEN I am able to connect to a database using Sequelize
WHEN I enter schema and seed commands
THEN a development database is created and is seeded with test data
WHEN I enter the command to invoke the application
THEN my server is started and the Sequelize models are synced to the MySQL database
WHEN I open API GET routes in Insomnia for categories, products, or tags
